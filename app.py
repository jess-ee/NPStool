Use a maximum of 5 labels for all combined answers. Focus the labeling on the cause of the dissatisfaction. Also provide an explanation of the label, keep general and do not use specific examples. Also provide a weight to each label according to how much it is mentioned in the answers. Use 100 points to divide over the 5 labels.   ##FormatMake sure the labels are as short and concrete as possible.  Use only English language to create labels. ##Input Label the following NPS input {NPSanswer}")
